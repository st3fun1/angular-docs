# Angular Docs App

## Development features

1. CMS to add documentation - using reactive forms (store it on a simple node.js server - in a file)
2. Idea - to stop having a lot of bookmarks -> create a extension which saves an website on my Angular Docs platform - for this I'll need a simple Node.js Server
